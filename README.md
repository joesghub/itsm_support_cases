# Support Case Walkthroughs

This repository contains **real-world IT support case studies** documenting how production issues were diagnosed, resolved, and validated in a live environment.

Each case is written as a structured walkthrough, focusing on:
- Clear problem definition
- Methodical troubleshooting
- Root cause identification
- Verified resolution
- Prevention and documentation

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate **practical support engineering skills**, clear technical communication, and disciplined incident resolution.

## Purpose of This Repository

Support work is often invisible, even though it requires strong technical judgment, communication, and systems thinking. This repository exists to:

- Make real support experience **explicit and reviewable**
- Show how I approach ambiguity, user-reported issues, and partial information
- Demonstrate structured troubleshooting under real constraints
- Provide artifacts that can be referenced in interviews and applications

All cases are based on **actual support incidents** handled in a campus IT environment.

## Case Studies Included

### 📄 Case 1: Restoring User Access to a Network Home Folder (macOS)

**Summary:**  
A macOS user was unable to access their network-based home folder via WebDAV, impacting their ability to open and save required files. Through targeted questioning and device-level diagnostics, the issue was identified as a local configuration problem rather than an account or system-wide outage.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- User access troubleshooting
- macOS filesystem and network storage workflows
- Authentication and configuration validation
- Clear user communication and confirmation-based resolution


### 📄 Case 2: Resolving VPN Connectivity Issues on macOS

**Summary:**  
A remote user was unable to connect to the campus VPN following a macOS update, preventing access to internal systems. The issue was traced to an outdated or misconfigured VPN client, resolved through client reinstallation and configuration validation.

**Skills demonstrated:**
- Secure remote access troubleshooting
- VPN client diagnostics
- Post-OS-update failure patterns
- Validation of functional access after resolution
